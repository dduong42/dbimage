# dbimage

This package adds a model to store images in the database.
[Django's documentation says it's a bad idea](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/models/fields/#binaryfield).
But, until it becomes a burden, I guess you can still try it.

For caching, I'm following this Heroku's article:
[Increasing Application Performance with HTTP Cache Headers](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/increasing-application-performance-with-http-cache-headers).
